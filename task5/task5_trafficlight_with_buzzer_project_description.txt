
ðŸš¦ Traffic Light System with Buzzer using CH32V003 â€“ Project Description
ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a traffic light system with a buzzer, implemented using the CH32V003 microcontroller. The system controls three LEDs (Red, Yellow, and Green) to simulate a real traffic signal. Additionally, a buzzer is included to alert vehicles and pedestrians when the yellow light is active, signaling a transition between stop and go.

The traffic light operates on a fixed time cycle, where:

Red LED (STOP) â†’ Lights up for 5 seconds.
Yellow LED (READY) + Buzzer â†’ Lights up for 2 seconds, with the buzzer beeping three times to warn drivers.
Green LED (GO) â†’ Lights up for 5 seconds.
This sequence repeats continuously, mimicking real-world traffic control systems.

ðŸ”¹ Objectives
To simulate a basic traffic light system using an embedded system.
To understand GPIO control for LEDs and a buzzer.
To implement delays for timing control.
To enhance real-world applications by adding a buzzer warning system.

ðŸ”¹ Working Principle
Microcontroller Initialization:

Configures GPIO pins as output for LEDs and the buzzer.
Enables system clock for smooth operation.
Traffic Light Operation:

Red LED (STOP) ON for 5s â†’ Vehicles must stop.
Yellow LED (READY) ON for 2s + Buzzer Beeps â†’ Warning before green.
Green LED (GO) ON for 5s â†’ Vehicles can move.
Cycle repeats continuously.
Buzzer Functionality:

The buzzer beeps three times during the yellow light phase.
This alerts drivers about the transition to the next signal.
